# RO_PUF_analysis
Hardware Security HW2

Problem 1:

Requirements for running hw2_p1.py: python 3.6, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, mpl_toolkits

F: Based on the inter and intra hamming distance histogram, this PUF would be useful for XX because it has small intra hamming distance.

H: The distribution is slightly better than the previous one but still has an obvious pattern.

I: Based on the results, a better method for selecting RO pairs would be random selecting non-overlapping RO pairs instead of using a fixed pattern.


Problem 2:

A: W

B: Watermarking provides ownership information that is hidden in the circuit and does not alter the function of the circuit. However, obfuscation denies unlicensed usage. The hardware will be usable only after apply a specific input sequence or key.
